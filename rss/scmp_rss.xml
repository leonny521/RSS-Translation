width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;号称是马来西亚有害的旧政治的解毒剂，并受到泰国激进的年轻人的启发前进党、马来西亚联合民主联盟 (Muda) 的初衷是吸引年轻选民，但它却在上周末的州选举中惨遭羞辱，失去了所有竞选的 19 个席位。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Muda 成立于 2020 年，从中汲取了灵感摘自“前进”，这是一场反对同样根深蒂固的权力的政治运动，在五月的选举中取得了压倒性的胜利。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该党的目标是引导马来西亚政治远离长期主导该国政治的年老中坚分子。几十年来，人们一直在叙述并交换领导职位。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但是，上周六的选举惨败，970 万张选票中仅获得了 30,000 票，至少就目前而言，这让“新政治”的呼吁化为泡影。 Muda 的联合创始人兼海报人物赛义德·萨迪克·赛义德·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼 (Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman)。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;糟糕的表现也暴露了一场有缺陷的竞选活动，许多人批评这场竞选活动既业余又脱节。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;选民反而这样做仍然忠于两个主要联盟的旧政治——多元文化的希盟 (PH) 和单一民族和伊斯兰主义的国民联盟 (PN)。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在槟城北赖 – 自 2008 年以来一直是希盟的据点– Muda 候选人 Vikneswary Harikrishnan 仅获得 253 票，是非独立候选人中最低的。该党极具魅力的信息主管卢克曼·朗 (Luqman Long) 在极度保守的登嘉楼州竞选，赢得的票数稍多一些，仅获得 372 票。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;穆达在雪兰莪州斯里实达的候选人 Dobby Chew 表示，遭到城市多元文化选民和乡村保守派的拒绝。结果并不令人意外，称选举胜利对于一个相对未经考验的政党来说是一项“艰巨的任务”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我更加确信马来西亚可以从政治上更进步的力量中受益，”周说。 “但要由像慕达这样的政党来推动公众支持和动员，并说服公众支持政治替代方案。”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;而反死刑活动人士周则竞选竞选活动的重点是社区的日常需求，而其他候选人则难以吸引所在地区的选民。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Abe Lim 在班达尔郊区席位开展了一场有关气候变化的竞选活动雪兰莪州的 Utama，让选民感到困惑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“作为一名选民，环境或气候问题并不是我首先想到的事情，”一位 TikTok 用户在她的竞选视频中评论道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于没有草根支持，该党还因反动和根据新闻中的热门问题改变竞选信息而受到严厉批评。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在网上，穆达试图取代的老人们却四处奔波。在澳大利亚新南威尔士大学教授政治传播的社会学家 Mark Ba​​hnisch 表示，互联网时代的成功归结为“ ”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“很多网民嘲笑 [Muda] 专注于清理垃圾，以及他们的活动看起来像学校或大学项目，”巴尼施说。 “相比之下，PN 则通过精心制作的内容来关注实际问题。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;与 Move Forward 对民主、非垄断和让泰国军队下台的“激光般的关注”相比，Bahnisch 表示 Muda 的信息“令人困惑和模糊”。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;从马来西亚到印度尼西亚，东南亚的伊斯兰主义者赢得了年轻选民&lt;/h3>;&lt;h3>;&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;慕达介入选举也触动了希盟的神经最初支持这个初出茅庐的政党，并放弃了六个据点地区的参选，让慕达可以在2022年柔佛州选举中直接挑战国阵。慕达只赢得其中一个席位。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;慕达瞄准与希盟相同的选民群体，宣传自己是对安瓦尔·易卜拉欣总理及其联盟失望的中间派和进步选民的“良心之声”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;马来西亚雪兰莪民意调查可能会推动对安瓦尔联合政府进行公投&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;虽然希盟成功在三个州掌权，但民主行动党公共政策委员会成员依斯干达法里兹表示，慕达转移了其注意力，“本来可以用来减轻国盟的压力。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在与希盟断绝关系后，政治分析家詹姆士·钦 (James Chin) 表示，慕达未来的选择“更糟糕”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;

width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;马来西亚必须专注于改善经济，以增加安瓦尔·易卜拉欣总理团结的机会政府在四年后赢得第二个任期。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;安瓦尔的执政联盟和反对派在上周的地区选举中各自保住了三个州的控制权。联合政府目前控制着 13 个州中的 9 个州的立法机构，这让它相信州级会有友好政党来执行雄心勃勃的国家经济议程。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在时间至关重要。马来西亚是两极分化、愤怒和分裂的。选民们疲惫不堪，国民情绪低落，生活成本和其他经济困境也无济于事。马来人是该国最大的族群，在政治上存在分裂，并倾向右倾保守派和伊斯兰政党，这些政党大肆兜售种族政治，攻击安瓦尔执政九个月的政府。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;安瓦尔的政治技巧将是对于马来西亚来说，扭转这一右倾趋势并化解充满种族歧视的政治至关重要。在11月大选无结果后，安瓦尔领导的联合政府不得不容纳声名狼藉的马来民族统一组织（巫统），安瓦尔是唯一具有国家信誉和政治资本的领导人。这才是他的精力最理想的用处。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;安瓦尔的联合政府花了不少时间勾勒出其经济路线图，并在州选举前几天才公布。&lt;/p>;&lt;该议程雄心勃勃，概述了关键承诺，例如将年增长率提高至 6%、提高停滞的实际工资以及减少不可持续的国家债务。安瓦尔政府还旨在通过提高税收和合理化补贴来提振公共财政，并打造绿色经济等新的增长引擎。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;改善该地区的经济一体化，特别是与邻国新加坡的一体化，也是一个重要的目标&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“事实是，我们陷入了高成本、低工资、低利润和缺乏竞争力的恶性循环，”76 岁的安瓦尔上个月末在坦率的评估中说道。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;安瓦尔警告说，如果不进行改革，马来西亚经济将面临“非常严重的危机”&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;国际上，环境也充满不确定性。全球经济不稳定，政治四分五裂，而在新冠疫情之后，人们的情绪显然是内向的。中国作为马来西亚最大的贸易伙伴和第一大外国投资者，是一大未知数。全球供应链的重组实际上可能对马来西亚有利，但如果迅速执行经济改革，其理由就会更加充分。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;过去五年政治危机带来的不确定性影响了国内信心投资者。这对吸引外国投资者的竞争产生了溢出效应，与马来西亚这样的全球一体化经济体相比，外国投资者更愿意在蓬勃发展的印度尼西亚和印度（这两个国家将于明年举行选举）冒险资本。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;只有当投资者对安瓦尔联合政府正在实施承诺的改革感到满意时，利息才会增加；仅靠演讲是行不通的。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;安瓦尔也是国家财政部长。他有充分的理由担任这一职务，因为他的党内没有人具备这样做的地位或经验。鉴于种族化的政治环境，这个角色必须留给占多数的马来族群。而巫统 — — 在上次大选中表现最差 — — 已经榨取了太多的内阁职位，以换取加入联合政府。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;安华的经济团队聪明而雄心勃勃，但也年轻且缺乏经验。东姑扎夫鲁阿齐兹 (Tengku Zafrul Aziz) 是投资、贸易和工业部长，也是上届政府的财政部长。然而，这位 50 岁的巫统高级领袖的内阁经验总共还不到三年。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;来自安瓦尔所在政党的拉菲兹南利 (Rafizi Ramli) 是一位 45 岁的首次部长，曾担任过内阁部长。重塑经济的艰巨任务。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;安华本人在25年前也曾担任财政部长，但当时的马来西亚和全球经济确实非常不同。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在支持安华的是一群由马来西亚能源巨头马来西亚国家石油公司 (Petronas) 前总裁兼首席执行官哈桑·马里坎 (Hassan Marican) 领导的杰出商业和经济领袖。尽管如此，这个团体只能充当善意的顾问，因为他们知道决定和执行政策的权力牢牢掌握在安瓦尔和他的内阁手中。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;什么衰退？马来西亚经济迎来22年来最佳增长&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;鉴于政治动态，安瓦尔将在可预见的未来继续担任财政部长。但他总是可以选择一名副驾驶，并任命第二位财政部长，他可以推动经济议程，并为安瓦尔提供专注于政治的空间。这并不是一个新概念，因为他的前任马哈蒂尔·穆罕默德、阿卜杜拉·巴达维和纳吉布·拉扎克都拥有副驾驶。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;副驾驶不仅必须具有政治信誉，而且还必须具备推动国家发展的技能。公务员——可以说是政府的执行者和经济发言人，尤其是在执行需要花费政治资本的艰难改革时。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;时间不在安瓦尔一边。下一次大选将在四年多后举行。为了下次赢得胜利，安瓦尔必须让马来西亚人感到经济强大和乐观。副驾驶可以帮助该国在下一次选举之前更快地到达目的地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈桑·贾弗里 (Hasan Jafri) 是新加坡 HJ Advisory 的董事总经理，为全球客户提供有关亚洲政治风险的建议。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 10:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[From Malaysia to Indonesia, Islamists backed by young voters gaining clout in Southeast Asia]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3231626/malaysia-indonesia-islamists-backed-young-voters-gaining-clout-southeast-asia?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.19 10:35&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8 /images/canvas/2023/08/19/7b122296-3474-46bf-9f3d-d6b0ef310e38_ad46ae7b.jpg&quot;

width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;1999 年 11 月，即现在臭名昭著的菲律宾海军舰艇 BRP Sierra Madre 事件发生五个月后故意在有争议的南海仁爱礁搁浅，马尼拉又搁浅了另一艘海军舰艇 BRP Benguet，这次是在黄岩岛搁浅。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;时任国防部长奥兰多·梅尔卡多 (Orlando Mercado) 告诉我们本周在亚洲，菲律宾时任海军中将路易斯托·费尔南德斯会见了他，并表示“任务完成”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梅尔卡多表示，他随后命令费尔南德斯“再寻找两到三艘登陆舰”坦克”在中国与五个东南亚国家的领土和海洋争端的核心地带的其他浅滩上搁浅。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;一艘生锈的旧菲律宾军舰为何卷入南海争端？&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;从菲律宾的角度来看，这是其阻止中国“悄悄入侵”国际公约规定的马尼拉领海的一种方式。梅尔卡多说，费尔南德斯警告他，中国人没那么容易上当受骗。 “先生，中国人可能不相信我们，”梅尔卡多援引他的话说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1999 年马德雷山脉搁浅背后的情况在 8 月 5 日事件发生后的最近几周成为人们关注的焦点，当时中国的行动– 包括发射高压水枪 – 迫使为船上人员补给的两艘菲律宾船只中的一艘返回。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;菲律宾和包括美国在内的几个西方国家谴责中国的行为是“危险的” ”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国则表示，其在距离最近的陆地海南岛 1,000 公里处作业的海岸警卫队是“专业且克制的”，并敦促菲律宾移走该船。报告称，马尼拉（称该浅滩为阿云金）数十年来多次违背了这样做的承诺。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当前的争论焦点在于菲律宾是否确实在 1999 年及其后做出了承诺，在总统约瑟夫·埃斯特拉达 (Joseph Estrada) 的领导下，放弃了浅滩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;前参议员、马尼拉第一位常驻东盟代表梅尔卡多 (Mercado) 以及爱德华多·玛丽亚·桑托斯 (Eduardo Maria Santos) 等其他人的观点和评论当 BRP 塞雷马德雷搁浅时，他是海军参谋长 - 已被仔细解析。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;虽然 86 岁的埃斯特拉达尚未发表评论，但他的儿子、参议院国防委员会主席金戈伊本周发布了一份声明声明强调，梅尔卡多已确认“没有协议或承诺”移除该船。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;人们普遍认为，菲律宾确实故意搁浅这两艘船，作为其对第二托马斯号主权主张的一部分浅滩和黄岩岛均位于其专属经济区 (EEZ) 内。 BRP Benguet 在 1999 年 11 月搁浅后立即被拖走。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;驻扎在二战时期摇摇欲坠的 BRP Sierra Madre 上的部队依靠补给任务来维护菲律宾的南中国海主权主张 - 这马尼拉表示，北京经常试图扰乱 - 为了在他们的远程驻地中生存。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;菲律宾海岸警卫队担心，如果军事分遣队离开，中国将寻求占领仁爱礁。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;菲律宾参议院的背后是什么？两党支持更加强硬的对华政策？&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;许多观察家担心南海争端是一个火药桶，任何误判或意外都可能引发军事冲突。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从马尼拉的角度来看事实上，BRP Sierra Madre 驻有其唯一的军事分队，保卫着石油和天然气资源丰富的礼乐滩，免遭中国的进一步入侵。 “阿云金岛距中国占领的美济礁仅 22 海里，”退役海军参谋长桑托斯告诉《亚洲周刊》。 “晚上，你可以[从马德雷山脉]看到庞加尼班的灯光，”现在已军事化并戒备森严。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周一，中国大使馆副团长周志勇在马尼拉的一个论坛上表示：“这是已经24年了，菲律宾方面仍未兑现承诺。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他表示，中国已要求现任总统小费迪南德·马科斯的政府“立即……拖走该船”，并进一步敦促马尼拉“周坚称，菲律宾政府早在1999年就同意撤走该船。“菲律宾方面也明确承诺这样做，”他说。 “这些陈述已被记录在案并有据可查。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，梅尔卡多向《亚洲周刊》断然否认任何此类协议的存在：“我们从未承诺过。没有这样的承诺。”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;尽管南海局势紧张，但菲律宾并未与北京处于“战备状态”&lt;/h3>;&lt;h3>;&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;通过采访和对事件的审查据报道，《亚洲本周》能够拼凑出到底发生了什么，导致中国相信马尼拉承诺撤走这艘军舰，但也给了梅尔卡多否认曾经做出过这样的承诺的回旋余地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;对于梅尔卡多来说，问题不是食言，而是针锋相对的反应。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他解释说，两艘船搁浅应该在中国突然扣押和扣押的背景下理解。 1995 年，菲德尔·拉莫斯 (Fidel Ramos) 担任总统期间，占领了庞加尼班礁 (Panganiban Reef)。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梅尔卡多表示，尽管存在外交抗议，中国也不会让步，并坚称其只是在庞加尼班礁 (Panganiban Reef) 上修建渔民小屋，以便在风暴期间避难，中国称其为“明治”角。 “但很快他们就用水泥结构加固了它。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Binobola naman tayo, e de bolahan tayo”，直言不讳的梅尔卡多说，大致可以翻译为：“因为他们在欺骗或欺骗玩我们，那就让我们互相玩吧”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们必须保护我们的利益。我们不能允许他们占领我们的地区，”他说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梅尔卡多说，他当时可能发表的任何誓言都应该在这种背景下考虑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;无论是否他和其他官员做出的移除这些船只的承诺——无论是明确的还是其他的——仍存在争议。虽然梅尔卡多否认曾这样做，但他当时的言论表明了一定程度的文字游戏 — — 大概是为了让中国人陷入困境。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;例如，在 1999 年 11 月的新闻发布会上，梅尔卡多被引述说： “我们正在尽最大努力修复搁浅的两艘船。此举将符合我们在该地区[不会建造]新建筑的政策”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梅尔卡多还表示，他向北京保证“已采取适当措施来评估船只受损程度[并且]将立即努力将船只从浅滩中解救出来”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当时可能有梅尔卡多所属的埃斯特拉达政府的原因，暗示两艘船将立即被拖走。埃斯特拉达是当年东南亚国家联盟峰会的东道主，日本、韩国和中国的高级领导人（以时任总理朱镕基为代表）出席了此次峰会。拟议的南海行为准则是​​会谈的首要议题，而围绕船只的对峙可能会在会议上造成尴尬。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;谈判几乎没有取得任何进展。据当时的媒体报道，BRP Benguet 于 11 月 29 日，即峰会结束后的第二天被拖走。 BRP Sierra Madre 仍然留在原地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;菲律宾大学法律中心海洋事务和海洋法研究所所长 Jay Batongbacal 表示，废弃的 BRP Sierra Madre 至今仍继续存在。仁爱礁“是为了主张和保护专属经济区和大陆架，这需要在中国声称拥有主权的海域中存在”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他指出，1999 年，马尼拉搁浅是“唯一可行的手段”在缺乏其他方法所需的海上能力和资源的情况下，可以尝试监视和阻止对菲律宾水域的进一步入侵。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;立法者敦促菲律宾需要新的贸易协议以远离中国&lt; /h3>;&lt;p>;前参议员安东尼奥·特里兰尼斯四世（当时是菲律宾海军中尉）表示，“据我所知，从未有过将 BRP Sierra Madre 号从阿云金撤走的命令”。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;如果有的话，现任总统小马科斯上周表示他将废除该法案。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梅尔卡多最近建议搁浅更多船只以监视浅滩。他还指出，由于 BRP Sierra Madre 仍然是一艘服役舰，“任何对其的攻击都会触发与美国的共同防御条约”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但特里兰尼斯对这一策略是否仍然有效表示怀疑，因为“2023 年的中国（比 1999 年）更具侵略性和敌对性。因此，任何此类举动都应被视为对中国类似侵略行为的回应。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;法新社补充报道&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 09:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[11 West Africa nations commit to a military deployment to restore ousted president of Niger: ‘ready to go anytime’]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3231627/11-west-africa-nations-commit-military-deployment-restore-ousted-president-niger-ready-go-anytime?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.19 09:32&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8 /images/canvas/2023/08/19/5c5bb5e6-a482-461d-a9f5-517c09654e1d_ce2a6716.jpg&quot;

Adding to the sector&#39;s misery were higher mortgage rates, at least a third more expensive compared with a year ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Optimism is in short supply for Hong Kong&#39;s real estate companies in the near term, and earnings are likely to disappoint. The mainland downturn is far from over and authorities remain reluctant to accept that the real estate profit model has changed,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at private equity investment firm Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hong Kong property has benefited from years of low US interest rates and strong Chinese growth but fortunes are in reverse gear now. Hong Kong&#39;s commercial banks raised their mortgage rates by nearly a fifth in the past year and China&#39;s economic troubles has had a swathe of research houses lowering their growth estimates.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the second quarter of 2023, the stock of unsold residential units rose to 19,085, the highest since 2003 when it had piled up to 22,000 units, according to Centaline Property Agency. Since then, mortgage rates have risen further with the latest round of increments announced last month following the Hong Kong monetary authorities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Lower average selling prices and higher interest rates are likely to erode developers&#39; margins and will have a lasting impact on bookings in the coming one to two years,” Sam Wong, equity analyst at US investment bank Jefferies told the Post. In a recent note, he trimmed earnings estimates of Hong Kong developers across the board, citing margins, higher interest expenses and the yuan depreciation, which factor in the sizeable mainland exposures of some of these companies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Yuan depreciation could be a headwind to select HK property names with relatively sizeable China exposures,” said Wong. “Historically New World Development, CK Asset, Hang Lung and Hongkong Land tend to perform more weakly in yuan depreciation cycles.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Earlier this year, a pickup in demand against a backdrop of better macro economic conditions was met with abundant backlog supply carried over from the second half of last year in the form of 12,000 units which had obtained presale approval and yet to be launched, according to Jefferies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The inventory overhang meant that the average price of new homes sold in June this year at HK$19,600 (US$2,508) per square foot was the lowest since HK$18,800 per square foot in September 2022, according to data from Dataelements, a data provider that tracks new residential properties in Hong Kong.

The property agency blamed it on the 15 per cent decline in home prices last year and the emigration wave.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The overall number of property transactions hit an eight-month low of 4,426 in July, according to Centaline, with losses piling for those desperate to sell.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tsoi also pointed to the plunge in land prices as a sign of the weak sentiment. The government&#39;s first land tender of the financial year in early July fetched the lowest price for Hong Kong Island since June 2002 and is more than 25 per cent lower than prices seen in November at the previous tender.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Meanwhile this slump presents an opportunity to do some housekeeping and clean up their balance sheets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Hong Kong property companies should weather the storm by reducing debt, increasing efficiency, &amp; focusing on the home market.

The city&#39;s growing collective of creative talent draws on a healthy bricolage of old, new, Asian and Western traditions along with organic trends in various stages of evolution, often using our post-industrial urban landscape as their canvas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When it comes to the art of Hong Kong&#39;s young people, we must encourage and enable more who find fulfilment in creative expression in any medium. In particular, we should offer them unfettered platforms – without sanitising the cacophony that renders the art so spontaneously powerful – through open-air exhibitions, street festivals and select studio spaces where the youth get to run the show.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why should we do so?最明显的原因是，年轻的创意表达是香港重新吸引未来人才和领导者的最有力手段之一，将个人和创意的实现放在首位。 It is also simply the best way to revitalise the aesthetics of our city.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Much ink and capital has been spilled on the devising of complex schemes for urban renewal. A far more effective solution can be found in engaging with our young people who are genuinely passionate about their community.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Encouraging budding artists to grapple and work, literally, with the past while invoking the future is precisely what street art can do for urban renewal. New Street, Lascar Court and Art Lane are but a few of the sites where artists have left their imprints, adding an artistic tinge to Hong Kong&#39;s vision of becoming a walkable city.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Transformative subcultures, such as grime in the United Kingdom and hip-hop in the US, emerged in poor, working-class neighbourhoods – East London and the Bronx in New York – as a form of youth expression.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Here in Hong Kong, the bohemian cafes on Tai Nan Street in Sham Shui Po and the vibrant HANDS basketball court in Tuen Mun have rejuvenated neighbourhoods and improved footfall.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is also a reputational dimension to the co-creation of youth-friendly cultures in the city.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The greatest cities of today are those that can harness youth-led ecosystems of creative expression – think Beijing, London, New York or Tokyo.在马德里，楚埃卡 (Chueca) 社区因庆祝多元化性取向和性别认同而闻名，帮助这座城市吸引了 LGBTQ 旅行者和进步人才。 Hong Kong&#39;s stimulating street culture can play a similar role.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;The Hong Kong drag group keeping things raw – forget RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Street culture is not just street art; it also includes photography, writing and music that draws on the cityscape, as well as the celebration of the values embedded within such creations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is something in it for everyone, whether it be the nuances of the murals painted by those who integrate nature into their repertoire, the unapologetically confrontational graffiti that interrogates everyday assumptions, or the photographs of densely packed housing blocks, such as the buildings on King&#39;s Road in Quarry Bay that found their way into Hollywood blockbusters Transformers: Age of Extinction and Ghost in the Shell.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Street art is an important conduit for teenagers and young adults to play a positive role in civic life and have a constructive dialogue with their peers and beyond. From the queer art challenging rigid norms on sexual orientation and gender identity to graffiti skewering the inequalities justified by a neoliberal logic, such as Banksy&#39;s work, there is much wisdom to be found in the radical, avant-garde displays on the street.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For far too long there has been a disconnect, between the youth and the elderly, between the bulk of Hong Kong&#39;s population and its elite. While supporting, appreciating and offering a platform for cathartic street art creation will not fix the problem altogether, it would at least contribute to its resolution.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Much as the future belongs to the youth, this city belongs to all of us. And it&#39;s our collective responsibility to make it more liveable, appealing and accommodating for all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 08:20:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall to fill 2,000 new job openings for fresh graduates as Chinese Big Tech firms seek new growth]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3231590/alibabas-taobao-and-tmall-fill-2000-new-job-openings-fresh-graduates-chinese-big-tech-firms-seek-new?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.19 07:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/18/52a880ab-9929-476d-bcc2-6cd1c9ae626e_87ad81d4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Alibaba Group Holding&#39;s domestic e-commerce unit Taobao and Tmall is hiring for more than 2,000 entry-level positions, in a new sign that Big Tech firms in China are gearing up for growth after years of downsizing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The unit, one of six major business groups under Alibaba, is looking for fresh graduates to fill roles ranging from engineering to algorithms and data in places including its hometown Hangzhou, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The recruitment effort forms part of an overall plan by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, to add 15,000 employees – including 3,000 fresh graduates – across the company this year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The tech giant&#39;s return to active hiring follows noticeable cuts in its payroll. Alibaba had 228,675 employees as of the end of June, down 6,541 from the end of March, according to its latest earnings report.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings, which announced on Thursday it would be offering a large number of openings at home and abroad, covering artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics and industrial internet, had also been slashing jobs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Shenzhen-based firm had 104,500 employees at the end of June, a decline of 6,200 from a year ago, its financial statements showed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;China&#39;s youth unemployment hit a new high in June, raising pressure for authorities to boost hiring of young people. The National Bureau of Statistics, which was expected to publish July figures on Tuesday, suspended the release of youth unemployment data, sparking public concerns that the situation could be worsening.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chinese tech giants, which had been under intense regulatory scrutiny over the past few years as Beijing moved to curb the “irrational expansion of capital” and pursue “common prosperity”, now plays an important role in absorbing some of the estimated 11.5 million university graduates who left school this summer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The government&#39;s crackdown on the internet industry had seen trillions of dollars wiped off company valuations and thousands of jobs eliminated. But as economic headwinds mounted, Beijing&#39;s attitude took a big turn in late 2022, as it began to highlight the positive value that internet platforms can bring to the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The National Development and Reform Commission, China&#39;s top economic planning agency, in July praised internet companies for “advancing high-level scientific and technological self-reliance efforts” and “contributing to the promotion of high-quality development”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That high-profile endorsement was followed by a friendly meeting between Chinese Premier Li Qiang and representatives from major tech companies, including Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian and Xiaohongshu founder Qu Fang.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With Beijing easing its control over Big Tech, several other tech firms have also expanded recruitment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Late last month, on-demand local services giant Meituan, which runs the country&#39;s leading food delivery platform, announced 6,000 new positions that were open to fresh graduates – up from 5,000 similar vacancies last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Kuaishou Technology, operator of China&#39;s No 2 short-video app, unveiled more than 200 new job openings that month.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Japanese wear clothes with built-in fans to beat the heat as temperatures soar to record high]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3231597/japanese-wear-clothes-built-fans-beat-heat-temperatures-soar-record-high?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.19 07:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/18/f20e4630-e273-4d39-b05e-b2241ac3fa06_42e29dd2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Selling jackets with built-in fans, neck coolers and T-shirts that feel cold, Japanese firms are tapping into a growing market for products to help people handle the summer heat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Japan – like other countries – is seeing ever-hotter summers. This July was the warmest in 100 years, with at least 53 people dying of heatstroke and almost 50,000 needing emergency medical attention.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Workman, which makes clothes for construction workers, launched a version of their fan-fitted jackets adapted for the high street in 2020 as demand grew.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The mechanism is simple – two electric, palm-sized fans powered by a rechargeable battery are fitted into the back of the jacket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They draw in air to then deliver a breeze – at variable speeds – onto the wearer&#39;s body.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The jackets retail for 12,000 to 24,000 yen (US$82-US$164).&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“As the weather gets hotter, people who have never worn fan-equipped clothing before want to find ways to cool down … so more people are interested in buying it,” Workman spokesman Yuya Suzuki said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Just like you feel cool when you are at home with a fan, you feel cool just by wearing [the jacket] because the wind is blowing through your body all the time,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Japan bakes as residents warned of once-in-a-decade, life-threatening heat&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Japanese summers are known to be hot and humid, but this July, Tokyo really sweated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The average temperature was 28.7 degrees Celsius (83.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest on record since 1875.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Heatstroke is particularly deadly in Japan, which has the second-oldest population in the world after Monaco.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;More than 80 per cent of heat-related deaths in the past five years have been among senior citizens.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Some people die from heatstroke,” said Nozomi Takai of MI Creations, a company selling neck-cooling tubes mainly to factory and warehouse workers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Individuals as well as companies are putting more and more effort into measures against it every year,” Takai said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The gel inside his firm&#39;s brightly coloured tubes – priced at 2,500 yen – is cool enough to use after 20 minutes in the fridge.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wearing it on the neck will “considerably cool the whole body” for about an hour, she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Takai&#39;s company joined an expo this year on “measures against extreme heat” in Tokyo to showcase new products that help users stay cool in the scorching heat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At another booth, Tokyo-based company Liberta had a series of clothing including T-shirts and arm sleeves using prints that make users feel cool – especially when they sweat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The prints use materials such as xylitol that feel cool when reacting with water and sweat, they said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chikuma, an Osaka-based company, has even created office jackets and dresses equipped with electric fans.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We developed them with the idea that it could be proposed in places where casual wear is not allowed,” Yosuke Yamanaka of Chikuma said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Regular fan-fitted clothes can make the wearer look puffy, as they need to be zipped up, and cuffs are tight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But jackets developed jointly by Chikuma, power tool maker Makita and textile giant Teijin do not need to be buttoned up, thanks to a special structure that sandwiches the fans in two layers and keeps the cool air in, Yamanaka said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Parasols, which are commonly associated in Japan with skin-tone-conscious women protecting against a summer tan, are now proving more popular with men too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Komiyama Shoten, a small, luxury umbrella maker in Tokyo, began making parasols for men around 2019 after the environment ministry encouraged people to use them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before, many male customers thought parasols “were for women and they were embarrassed”, the owner Hiroyuki Komiya said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Once you use it, you can&#39;t let go,” he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Heatwaves to hit China every 5 years as extreme weather events multiply: study&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;On the busy streets of popular tourist destination Asakusa, Kiyoshi Miya, 42, said he decided to “use his umbrella as a parasol”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It&#39;s like I&#39;m always in the shade and the wind feels cool,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another visitor, Shoma Kawashima, wore a wearable fan around his neck to stay cool under the blazing sun.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It&#39;s so hot I want to be naked,” the 21-year-old said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Gadgets are helpful, but “not a solution” to rising temperatures, he added.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mpox cases rise in China, but

width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Hazmat suits, PCR tests, quarantines and contact tracing – it was hard not to feel a sense of déjà vu a few weeks ago when the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines on containing a disease outbreak.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But what was happening was not another Covid-19 wave. Rather, the Chinese government was addressing a potentially significant new public health concern: mpox.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that China is currently experiencing the world&#39;s fastest increase in cases of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), and the country needs to act quickly to contain the spread.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While the Americas and Europe have mostly contained the mpox outbreak that started in mid-2022, Asia has emerged as the disease&#39;s new hotspot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Japan, South Korea and Thailand, which all saw sporadic imported cases last year, have reported weekly new case numbers in the double digits in 2023, meaning the virus has been spreading in the domestic population.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But according to the latest data reported to the WHO, China has surpassed all other countries in the world, with 315 confirmed cases in the past three months – although irregular case reporting from Beijing makes it impossible to know the true scale of the disease at this point.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&#39;No need to panic&#39; over Hong Kong&#39;s spike in mpox cases, as vaccination centre opens&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Mpox is less contagious than Covid-19, but since 2022 more than 88,000 people have contracted the disease, which can be painful, and debilitating for some. More than 150 people have died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some countries have been more successful than others at containing domestic mpox outbreaks – and much of their success is arguably a result of proactive measures such as vaccination campaigns. But the Chinese government has barely started to take action.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Compared with the response to Covid-19 […] the [Chinese] response is certainly dramatically different,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Even though [mpox] is less likely to develop into a large outbreak in the country, the Pollyanna attitude may encourage the spread of the disease among the at-risk population – unless they take a more active campaign against the disease.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In May, the WHO declared that mpox was no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), because cases had gone down significantly in countries that had seen large outbreaks last year, mostly in the Americas and Europe. (Mpox has been endemic in West and Central Africa for decades and remains so.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Overall, compared to where we were last year, we&#39;re definitely in a different place,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious-disease doctor and chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America&#39;s Global Health Committee. “We have much fewer cases, but we are seeing sporadic outbreaks in different parts of the world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Indeed, by the time the WHO rescinded the PHEIC declaration, many Asian countries were already starting to see an uptick. Japan was the first Asian country to report a significant increase in mpox cases, in March.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In May, a report by researchers in the country warned that the disease could surge across Asia, owing to the connection between Japan and other Asian countries, and the low mpox vaccination rate in the region.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If the outbreak grows to the level it did in the West, the researchers noted, more than 10,000 cases might be expected in Japan alone before mpox is successfully contained.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is less clear what exactly is happening in China.根据世界卫生组织收集的数据，5月至7月中国报告新增MPO病例315例。 A case count this high suggests that not all cases were travel-related.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But – in another situation reminiscent of its Covid-19 response – China isn&#39;t as forthcoming as other countries with its disease data;它不每周发布新病例报告。 Rather, it has released a one-time report of the number of mpox cases recorded in June: 106.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Hong Kong to open dedicated mpox vaccination centre on Thursday&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;The Chinese government didn&#39;t release data from May and, at the time of writing, hasn&#39;t released any data about July cases.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The WHO, though, includes case counts from Taiwan, which has its own government and Centres for Disease Control, and Hong Kong in its China numbers.而且公众没有办法分离数据。 So the 315 number includes the 106 cases Beijing says it identified in June, plus the number of infections in Taiwan and Hong Kong over May, June and July.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This all further obscures the true number of mpox cases in mainland China – even though it is critical during an infectious-disease outbreak to be on top of things as soon as possible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We also need to understand more about the people that have been infected,” Kuppalli says, “such as […] the demographics, the clinical presentation, their immune status and about how they&#39;ve been presenting to care. I think that type of information is important.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The lack of clarity on how the disease has spread has caused some people in China to panic.该国开始出现MPO病例的消息已经流传了数周。 But not until July 26 did China&#39;s CDC and health ministry co-publish new guidance on how to prevent its spread, and even that left questions unanswered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The directive asked that all confirmed mpox patients transfer to a medical facility for quarantine unless they have only mild symptoms.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It said contact tracing going back three weeks would be conducted for every patient, and their close contacts would be asked to self-quarantine for three weeks. It also recommended that local authorities monitor the mpox virus level in waste water in certain areas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What makes monitoring the outbreak more difficult in China is that, as in the West, the current mpox spread has been seen mostly among communities of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And similar to what happened in the US and Europe, that association is consistently misinterpreted in China to suggest that mpox is only an STD spread by gay men through sexual activity – a particularly dangerous connection, as the LGBTQ community is increasingly targeted in the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many Chinese social media users who have spotted men with skin lesions in public have been posting their photos to ask whether it is an mpox symptom. And the Chinese name for mpox – houdou – has also been thrown around casually as a slur against gay men.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To stop the spread of mpox, public health officials need to strike a delicate balance between destigmatising the disease by dispelling the idea that it affects only gay men and prioritising the MSM communities that are most vulnerable to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Working with the people that are affected, helping to have non-stigmatising language and communication, has been hugely effective in helping to curb the outbreak” in the West, Kuppalli says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So far, some LGBTQ communities in China feel they are on their own. M, who works for a queer rights organisation in Guangzhou and asked to be identified only by his first initial given the sensitivity of his work, points out that the CDC recommended waste-water monitoring specifically near venues that MSM communities frequent, including bars, clubs and saunas.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Anti-LGBTQ China mouthpieces and &#39;Christian&#39; bigots don&#39;t speak for Hong Kong&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;He says this has become controversial within the Chinese LGBTQ community, and that some organisers feel this puts a target on their backs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another LGBTQ organiser, Suihou, in Hubei province, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym, says that even though contact tracing information is supposed to be strictly confidential, he has seen one example in which an mpox patient&#39;s private information, including phone number, national ID, address and HIV status, was leaked and passed around on social media.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Organisers such as M and Suihou are doing their own work to mobilise a disease response. To spread information about mpox prevention, M has recently sent text messages to 700 people and hosted in-person lectures that reached more than 900 people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Suihou has worked with one mpox patient closely, helping him get testing and treatment.他说，并非所有他们遇到的医务人员都接受过如何处理这些病例敏感性的培训； during the contact tracing process, the doctor told the patient that this disease is a problem for “your kind of people”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Suihou warns that some people may avoid seeking medical help altogether, particularly given the lack of state support for mandatory quarantine and contact tracing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“From the individual cases that I have heard of, everyone who has a confirmed case is being asked to go to a quarantine facility,” Suihou says. But, he explains, since the government has not provided a budget to help cover the quarantine, as it did with Covid-19, patients have no choice but to pay for the hospital stay and all medical tests out of their own pockets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many marginalised individuals, who are also more vulnerable in an infectious-disease outbreak, may not be able to afford that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“With the slowdown of the [Chinese] economy, local governments don&#39;t have the physical capacity or even the willingness to invest more in public health,” Huang says.即使是世界卫生组织也没有专门用于预防流行性腮腺炎的资金； it has been using its emergency fund to cover mpox-related work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A lot of the financial burden will again fall on local organisers. M says his organisation is using funds intended for HIV prevention to conduct mpox outreach work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;All of this could further discourage people who get infected from seeking medical tests and treatment. This in turn would make the community spread of mpox even harder to track – and could undermine prevention efforts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As with Covid-19, vaccination is one of the best ways to get mpox under control. Worldwide, three vaccines are currently being used for mpox prevention: ACAM2000, MVA-BN (also known as JYNNEOS in the US) and LC16m8.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;All these vaccines were originally designed for protection against smallpox but have been found effective against mpox.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Monkeypox to be renamed mpox by WHO&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;The US has administered more than 1.2 million MVA-BN and ACAM2000 shots. And in Asia, South Korea imported 10,000 MVA-BN shots last year and is planning to procure another 20,000 this year, while Taiwan, despite its small size, has procured and administered more than 72,000 MVA-BN shots so far.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Japan, meanwhile, has relied on a Japanese company to produce its own LC16m8 while also donating doses of the vaccine to countries including Colombia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But none of these vaccines has been approved for use in China. The situation recalls China&#39;s refusal to import any mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, instead relying on a few home-grown vaccines that were shown to be less effective.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In this case, though, the country doesn&#39;t currently produce any of its own smallpox vaccines; production was terminated after smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bavarian Nordic, the Danish company that produces the MVA-BN vaccine, says it can&#39;t disclose client information unless requested by the government and can&#39;t confirm whether China has procured any MVA-BN shots. But it says the company is not in the process of applying to register the vaccine in China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The WHO also has a sharing mechanism in place that allows member states to receive vaccines if needed.但目前尚不清楚中国是否已经申请了mpox疫苗。 The organisation did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether there are plans to send vaccines to China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The new Chinese CDC guidance on mpox made no mention of any vaccine as part of its outbreak response.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It&#39;s quite unlikely that China will focus on procuring vaccines at this moment, since there&#39;s no precedent and [no] emergency approval of the vaccines. Rather, there seems to be a focus on surveillance, monitoring, quarantine, contact tracing, etc,” says Zoe Leung, a senior associate at Bridge Consulting, a Beijing-based communication consultancy specialising in public health.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It may not be this way forever: Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company, announced in November 2022 that it had developed the world&#39;s first mRNA vaccine against mpox, and it has been found to be effective in preclinical studies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On July 13, Sinopharm officially applied for clinical trial approval for a “replication-defective mpox vaccine”, though it is unclear whether these are the same products.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sinopharm did not immediately reply to questions about its mpox vaccine development.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“There is domestic research [into an mpox vaccine], but we don&#39;t know when it can be commercially available. It will take a long time,” says M. “I have some friends who have already travelled to Hong Kong or Macau to get vaccinated against mpox.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But for Chinese people to get vaccinations outside mainland China, there is often a high cost, a long wait and layers of bureaucracy to wade through. It&#39;s again similar to trends seen earlier in the pandemic, when Chinese people with means travelled to Hong Kong to get mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean [Beijing is] not interested in vaccines,” says Huang, “but there&#39;s this technology nationalism that discouraged them from rapid approval of the use of foreign vaccines.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And that, he warns, “certainly contributed to the rapid increase in Covid-related mortalities”.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Wildfires threaten western Canada’s Kelowna as far north evacuated: ‘100 years of firefighting in one night’]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3231625/wildfires-threaten-western-canadas-kelowna-far-north-evacuated-100-years-firefighting-one-night?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.19 06:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/19/86ffa928-e7e4-4551-b258-5ca8bf693808_6935f281.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Wildfires on Friday bore down on Kelowna in western Canada – a city of 150,000 – while efforts to clear Yellowknife in the far north turned it into a ghost town as scorching flames burned ever closer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two fronts in British Columbia and the Northwest Territories are just the latest in a summer of devastating wildfires across the country that have forced tens of thousands from their homes and left millions of acres scorched.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Kelowna, officials described “a hard night” beating back flames, at times forcing crews to pull back and some firefighters to become trapped behind lines while making “heroic efforts” to rescue residents.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We fought hard last night to protect our community,” West Kelowna fire chief Jason Brolund told a briefing on Friday. “A significant number of structures were lost,” he said, but no injuries or fatalities were reported.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It was like 100 years of firefighting all at once, in one night,” he said, adding that he expects “another scary night tonight” under an eerie glow of the fires.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nearly 2,500 homes and businesses on Kelowna&#39;s west side were ordered evacuated late Thursday, while another 4,800 were advised to be ready to leave at a moment&#39;s notice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The city is nestled in the Okanagan Valley that is home to some of the country&#39;s top wineries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The emptying of Yellowknife continued in the far north, meanwhile, with cars snaking along the lone highway connecting the remote capital of the Northwest Territories to southern Alberta province ahead of a 12pm deadline.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Chinese scientists calculate mammoth emissions from Canadian wildfires&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;The exodus has also continued by air, with thousands of residents flying out and an increased number of flights scheduled Friday to evacuate the regional capital&#39;s more than 20,000 inhabitants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The nearest evacuation centre is 1,150km (700 miles) away, in Alberta, where several sites have been set up. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet refugees in the provincial capital Edmonton in the afternoon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Air Canada pilot Chad Blewett, who flew one of the first relief flights out of Yellowknife, told public broadcaster CBC that the lakeside city was “pretty empty already.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The stragglers, he said, were mostly essential workers “building fire breaks and working with airlines [to facilitate evacuations].”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Crews have scrambled to erect defences as the flames approached Yellowknife, while water bombers have been seen flying low over the city.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strong winds over the next two days will send the fire, already within just a few kilometres of the city&#39;s perimeter, “in directions we don&#39;t want”, Northwest Territories&#39; fire information officer Mike Westwick said late on Thursday.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Several military aircraft have already been dispatched, along with more than 120 soldiers to help beat back the flames.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Defence Minister Bill Blair told reporters “conditions remain very difficult” in the north, and warned that the highway out of the city was open “for now”. As the evacuation winds down, he said, “the priority [will now be] to make sure that Yellowknife and all its property are safe”.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&#39;It&#39;s scary&#39;: New York has world&#39;s worst air as Canada fire smoke drifts south&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;The flight from Yellowknife means half the population of the near-Arctic territory has been displaced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Several towns and Indigenous communities were also already under evacuation orders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Canada is experiencing a record-setting wildfire season, with official estimates of over 13.7 million hectares (33.9 million acres) already scorched. Four people have died so far.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition, the fires have also emitted an unprecedented amount of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Scientists say human-caused global warming is exacerbating natural hazards, making them both more frequent and more deadly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It shows how quickly our climate is changing if a place like Yellowknife, so close to the Arctic Circle, is on fire,” Adria McPherson told the CBC while fleeing the fires in the north by car.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The evacuation of Yellowknife is the second time an entire Canadian city has been cleared due to wildfires since 100,000 residents of Fort McMurray in Alberta&#39;s oil and gas producing heartland were forced out in 2016.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Earlier this year, suburbs of Halifax on the Atlantic coast were also evacuated.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 19 Aug 2023 06:50:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
