width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;欧洲的一个政府间组织正在与一家中国科技巨头密切合作，以带来人工智能人工智能（AI）进入天气预报。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上周一，欧洲中期天气预报中心（ECMWF）在其网站上推出了能够预测全球天气的中国人工智能模型。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该模型名为“盘古天气”，由华为技术有限公司开发。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;通过此次合作，这家中国科技公司将天气背后的科学转化为实际应用，而欧洲气象局也开始在其业务中采用人工智能。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在周六接受《南华早报》独家采访时，华为首席项目科学家田奇讨论了两个组织之间的合作，以及在气象领域使用人工智能的潜力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;p>;“将盘古天气纳入预报的决定部分是由于该模型的高性能，并且 ECMWF 认识到人工智能在该领域的巨大潜力，”田说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;盘古天气预报计算成本低得多，同时在精度方面仍具有竞争力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“今年4月至7月的大量对比测试表明，盘古模型在多项精度指标和极端天气预报方面都显示出优势。这似乎就是 ECMWF 决定调整该模型的原因。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;根据 7 月在科学杂志《自然》上发表的一篇论文，盘古模型的预测精度比传统的数值预测更高。方法。可以提前1小时到7天预测天气，预测速度提高10000倍。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“目前，盘古天气可以提供秒级到秒级的全球天气预报，涵盖湿度、风速、温度、海平面气压等方面，模型在预测台风路径、寒潮、热浪等方面表现出色。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;“全球沸腾”：最近的头条新闻揭示了气候危机的现实&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;人工智能天气预报员最近预测了台风“多克苏里”的轨迹，并准确预测了8月4日台风“卡农”的急转弯。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田说，该模型为世界各地的气象局提供了重要信息。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“专业预报员一直在使用盘古天气的预测作为参考。许多气象爱好者也在网上关注其在台风路径预测方面的表现。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“华为的最终目标是利用盘古天气打造下一代AI天气预报框架。它旨在提高天气预报的准确性和速度，从而帮助人类更好地应对极端天气条件。我们也在与中国气象局洽谈合作。”田说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;全球天气预报员、气象学家和公众现在可以在网站上获取盘古天气的10天全球天气预报。&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;当《华盛顿邮报》联系 ECMWF 询问其在人工智能使用方面的立场时，一位女发言人指出该组织网站上最近发布的一篇博客文章，其中写道：“现在是拥抱这项技术并建立物理建模和 ML [机器学习] 的最佳平衡是什么，以继续改进预测。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自 2020 年以来，美国出于国家安全考虑对华为实施制裁。与此同时，据《金融时报》6 月份的报道，欧盟一直在考虑强制禁止成员国使用被认为在其 5G 网络中存在安全风险的公司，其中包括华为。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但是 Florian Pappenberger 博士， ECMWF 预报部门主管将人工智能模型描述为天气预报的“安静革命”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“基于机器学习的数据驱动建模在天气预报方面展现出巨大潜力。一些应用已经取得了快速进展，取得了令人印象深刻的结果。 ML 方法的采用可能会彻底改变传统数值天气预报的进步。”他的团队 7 月份在 ArXiv 网站上发表的一篇论文中说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;天气模式是混乱的，无法预测。即使是最强大的超级计算机也能准确计算。但人工智能模型可以提取一些人类无法提取的特征，从而给出更好的结果。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们认为人工智能模型可以从海量数据中揭示新的大气演化模式。人工智能的发展有助于打破传统预报的垄断，克服数值天气预报精度的瓶颈。人工智能将成为气象领域的游戏规则改变者，华为是重要的参与者。”田说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;人工智能模型并不完美。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“在台风中虽然盘古天气在预测总体趋势方面可能更准确，但由于人工智能使用的初始数据不同，它在预测台风的具体登陆点方面可能会滞后。”谢灵曦在中国知乎上写道。他拥有北京清华大学机器学习博士学位，现任华为高级研究员。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“由于训练过程中极端天气数据比例较低，当前的人工智能方法可能会低估台风强度。以及缺乏对物理定律的考虑。因此，目前台风强度预测仍应更多地依赖数值模型。”他说。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 09:50:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[More Hong Kong delivery riders expected to file claims for unpaid wages after tribunal ruling that ‘couriers are employees’]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3230887/more-hong-kong-delivery-riders-expected-file-claims-unpaid-wages-after-tribunal-ruling-couriers-are?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 09:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8 /images/canvas/2023/08/12/b15b0649-970e-4304-97cb-0a82239a5114_a05f4999.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但是，如果没有得到认可的雇佣关系，员工可能无法获得与工作相关的保险和其他基本法律保护，例如确保工资支付、工资扣除限制和公共假期休假的保护。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;长期以来一直将外卖工人视为个体经营者的主要外卖平台并未表示在仲裁庭裁决后是否会重新审查雇佣协议。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Deliveroo 发言人表示，该公司将8 月中旬升级员工保险，并推出一些燃油和车辆维护奖励。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他补充说，该公司使用了超过 10,000 名乘客，最近的一项民意调查显示，五分之四的人喜欢工作带来的灵活性。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;香港是否还有空间开展第三家食品配送服务？&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Foodpanda 和 Lalamove 表示，他们为送货骑手提供了保险和紧急支持。前者表示，已增加了事故发生者的医疗费用保障。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;岭南大学副教授梁玉玲曾对少数族裔送餐员进行过研究，她表示，许多人并不知道他们的权利或获得保险的机会。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许多人在没有任何具有法律约束力的雇佣合同的情况下就报名了工作，她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“当工人们如此迫切地需要一份工作时，他们被迫接受困难。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;梁表示，仲裁庭的裁决对工人来说是一个“突破”，她希望这能鼓励更多人争取自己的权利。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;获胜的 Zeek 骑手7月25日，他的案件获得了一个月约8,000港元的拖欠工资。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这位自称姓岳的49岁男子表示，他去年9月在该公司工作，负责收集和运送包裹每天工作近 10 个小时。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他说他知道被视为个体经营者的风险。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我只是想给这份工作一个机会无论如何，尝试一下，”他说。 “10月份工资没有发来，我感到非常失望和无助。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他向香港基督教工业委员会辖下的骑手权益关注小组寻求帮助。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>; Foodpanda Hong Kong，快递员经过两轮谈判达成薪酬协议&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;岳表示，与快递公司的经历让他不再做送货员。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“雇主总是有一切手段寻找法律漏洞，让你成为个体户。你别无选择，因为你是弱势群体。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;岳补充说，尽管他在法庭上获胜，但他对该行业是否很快会发生重大变化感到悲观。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;律师处理过劳工权利案件的林正文表示，仲裁庭的裁决对其他平台的影响有限，因为它“对进一步的案件没有约束力”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;除非提出上诉上级法院的决定和裁决具有约束力，他并不认为Zeek案可以成为类似案件的参考。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;香港工联会议员郭议员建议政府审查雇佣法，为快递员提供更多保护。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西班牙2021年推出的《骑手法》将配送平台运营商及其工人视为依赖雇佣关系。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;郭说：“当局应该尽快拿出解决方案。这是一个紧迫的问题，刻不容缓。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;劳工部发言人表示，将“继续探索适当措施，加强对平台工人的保护”，包括审查其他地方采取的措施。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;p>;但他补充，其他国家政策或措施的成效仍有待观察。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该部门表示，已要求政府统计处进行概况调查。以及该行业员工的工作条件。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 09:50:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[World’s first mass-produced humanoid robot?

width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;当 Fourier Intelligence 在 2020 年展会上推出其瘦长、漆黑的人形机器人 GR-1 时7 月在上海举行的世界人工智能大会 (WAIC) 立即抢尽风头。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;虽然自 11 月 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 推出以来，全球科技界一直关注人工智能 (AI) 软件，但中国制造的GR-1——据说能够以每小时5公里的速度用两条腿行走，同时承载50公斤的负载——让人们想起了从特斯拉到小米等跨国公司正在追求的双足机器人的潜力。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于上海的初创公司 Fourier 来说，GR-1 是一次不太可能的胜利。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“这是我们一次前所未有的尝试 - 当它出现时我们几乎没有任何参考资料Fourier 创始人兼首席执行官 Alex Gu 最近在中国金融之都接受《南华早报》采访时表示。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fourier 的关注点并不总是在人形机器人上。该公司以 19 世纪法国数学家和物理学家约瑟夫·傅里叶 (Joseph Fourier) 的名字命名，最初于 2015 年在上海科技中心张江成立，旨在开发康复机器人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该公司目前的产品包括智能健身车、无线机器人手套和一系列计算机引导的装置，帮助用户恢复手臂和腿部的运动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但就像他的许多同龄人一样，42 岁的顾是机械工程专业的毕业生来自上海交通大学的他一直梦想着创造自己的人形机器人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于是在2019年，Fourier将其智能康复设备带入了10多个国家的数百家医院和医疗中心，并在全球站稳脚跟。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当时，由于技术壁垒和开发成本较高，世界上很少有公司能够成功推出人形机器人。在美国，有一些项目，包括波士顿动力公司的Atlas（该公司以机器狗Spot而闻名）和Agility Robotics的Digit。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在中国，大多数公司选择将精力集中在轻量化上。四足机器人等产品。顾认为他可以做得更好。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“康复机器人中使用的许多技术本质上也适用于人形机器人，”顾说。 “人形机器人需要非常好的电机，既强大又轻便，我们能够自己开发它们。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;GR-1诞生于傅里叶总部一楼的一个小实验室，那里上个月记者走访时，一群工程师正在忙着改进和测试机器人。该团队在 2022 年（项目启动三年后）取得了重大突破，成功使这个 1.65 米高的机器人能够用双腿站立并行走。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“当我们看到它站立时第一次不受束缚地自行行走，这对我们所有的工程师来说都是一个很大的鼓励。”顾说。 “感觉就像抚养一个刚出生的婴儿。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fourier 后来在网上发布了一段 GR-1 行走的视频，得到了很多观众的称赞，但也有很多人持怀疑态度。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“一些海外观众表示该视频是计算机生成的，”顾说。 “我知道这个领域还处于早期阶段，人们会有不同的看法，就像20年前有人争论电动汽车是否能够在道路上行驶一样。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;除了尽管存在技术挑战，研究人员和机器人专家警告说，企业在更广泛的消费市场中将人形机器人商业化仍面临巨大困难。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“[人形机器人]现在大多生活在实验室中，而且非常昂贵，”说张晓荣，中国神都科技研究院院长。 “一台质量相对较高的机器可能要花费数百万元。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些问题并没有阻止企业尝试。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国智能手机巨头小米创始人雷军，2022 年 8 月在舞台上展示了​​该公司的第一个人形机器人 Cyber​​One，它被认为能够行走，但除此之外没有什么其他功能。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不到两个月后，特斯拉亿万富翁创始人埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 推出了原型机在公司的人工智能日期间展示其备受期待的 Optimus 机器人。它在舞台上现场行走和跳舞。观众还观看了一段机器人执行搬运盒子和移动金属棒等任务的视频。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;马斯克在上个月的 WAIC 会议上表示，Optimus 的目的并不是“拥有极高的智能”，而是为了帮助人类完成“无聊、重复或危险的任务”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;顾说他与马斯克有着相似的愿景，但补充说机器人“也可以通过提供情感价值成为人类非常好的朋友”。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;虽然当前的人形机器人“在运动和认知能力方面与人类仍有很大差距”，但大型语言模型 (LLM)（支持 ChatGPT 等人工智能聊天机器人的软件类型）的开发可能会“改变时代” ”，顾说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“法学硕士将赋予机器人逻辑推理的能力，使它们变得更像人类，”顾说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;虽然顾强调傅立叶将专注于Fourier 联合创始人兼首席战略官 Zen Koh 表示，一些人工智能公司已经在法学硕士领域寻求潜在合作，他们开发构成机器人“身体”的硬件，并让人工智能开发人员专注于“大脑”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们希望与所有主要企业合作，并且……作为一个系统，保持开放，”Koh 说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;GR-1 机器人已经以小型形式交付。顾说，数量给一些大学和人工智能公司进行研发。他计划在年底前开始量产，并在 2024 年交付数千台。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;马斯克去年还声称可以在 2023 年开始生产。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;顾预计傅里叶的人形机器人，他表示，在养老、教育、宾客接待等多种场景中，该机器人具有巨大的潜力，未来三到五年将比康复机器人产生更多的收入。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过，还有很长的路要走。在人形机器人成为我们日常生活的一部分之前，他说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“不要指望一年左右就会出现奇迹 - 即使对于特斯拉来说，我们也必须给他们时间[以实现大规模生产人形机器人]，”顾说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“但是，不要低估这个东西可能在五年或十年内成为人们家庭生活一部分的可能性。”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 08:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘The first Chinese chief in Africa’, but does he – and others like him – wield any real influence?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3230814/first-chinese-chief-africa-does-he-and-others-him-wield-any-real-influence?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 07:45&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8 /images/canvas/2023/08/11/f14e5c78-08bd-4385-89da-72f8e5560c4a_6b076722.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;50岁时，前英语教师胡杰国移居尼日利亚并建立了一家价值数百万美元的中式酒店，当时东亚面孔在那里并不常见。现年 70 多岁的胡生活在拉各斯，周围都是政府资助的、手持冲锋枪的警卫。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡在 2001 年被授予酋长头衔时得到了这种保护，这对于非非洲人来说是一项罕见的荣誉。胡锦涛当时表示，这个头衔并没有什么特别之处，只是他现在可以“随时见到州长和总统”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;十七年后，他身穿金色长袍，戴着圆顶小帽。尼日利亚西南部约鲁巴部落的胡锦涛做客中央电视台，讲述他作为“非洲第一位华人酋长”的一生。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡锦涛以此身份为当地政府提供涉华建议并帮助中国公民在尼日利亚遇到问题。就连中国驻尼日利亚大使也会向胡锦涛咨询。&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;为什么硅谷的中国风险投资家的聚会结束了&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;中华全国侨联出版的《国内外》杂志一位海外华人大使表示，“胡杰国像熊猫一样稀有，我们需要好好保护他。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡杰国出生于 1948 年，与母亲和兄弟姐妹在上海长大。 。他的父亲前往香港创办纺织生意。然而，二战后国际局势动荡，加上共产党在中国取得胜利，香港经济变得低迷。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;因此，跟随一位将生意迁往英国殖民地尼日利亚的朋友，胡的父亲也搬到了那里。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;多年来，胡老在拉各斯建造了纺织厂，与包括奥卢塞贡·奥巴桑乔（1999年至2007年担任尼日利亚总统）在内的政治家成为朋友，并成为当地海外领导人中国人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;随着年龄的增长，他梦想着将家族生意传给儿子，但小胡更感兴趣的是把他来之不易的教师生涯留在家乡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;胡锦涛是文革后期（1966-1976）第一批进入大学的“工农兵”学生之一。政治运动叫停了全国高考，抢走了那些被送到农村向农民学习、当农场工人的年轻人的教育机会。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1970年至1976年间，少数幸运的工人、农民和士兵被选入大学，不是根据学业成绩，而是根据他们的工作经验。其中就有胡，他选择了英语专业，并于1972年毕业成为一名英语教师。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上课时，他在黑板上写下：“为了革命，我们必须努力学习英语。” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;文化大革命期间，中国基本上对外界关闭，胡担心如果他表现出移居国外的意图，就会受到政治迫害，但这种情况在 1977 年左右发生了变化，时任中国驻尼日利亚大使冯玉九和胡父亲的一个朋友到上海看望胡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“胡老师，”冯告诉他，“华侨领袖也需要一个接班人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最后，在1978年，中国改革开放之年，胡锦涛抵达拉各斯，由于担心国内政局不明朗以及未知的非洲大陆，胡锦涛最初的不情愿在冯的坚持下被克服了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;然而，胡认为，曾让他父亲受益匪浅的纺织业已经饱和。他想做自己的事情，所以他开始在一家酒店餐厅工作，很快就晋升为经理。随后前往加拿大学习酒店管理。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;回到拉各斯后，他于1997年投资800万美元建造了金门餐厅及酒店。该建筑采用中国风格设计，有两个房间。入口处有白色的守护狮子。政客和商人纷纷涌入，进一步扩大了胡氏家族的网络。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当他的父亲与奥巴桑乔总统​​交往时，胡锦涛与时任拉各斯州长、尼日利亚现任总统博拉·蒂努布成为了朋友。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;甚至在胡成为部落酋长之前，他就在尼日利亚和中国政府之间轻松调动，而酋长头衔只会增加他的影响力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自 1998 年以来，胡一直帮助中国公司在尼日利亚投资。中国土木工程建设公司 (CCECC) 就是一个例子，该公司获得了一个价值 5.6 亿美元的项目，用于改造和维护一条 3,000 公里（1,860 英里）长的铁路。胡锦涛还接见了中国石油天然气集团公司代表团，并向尼日利亚石油资源部长介绍了他们。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡锦涛与中国各省合作，在尼日利亚举办商品交易会、开设工业园，吸引中国私营企业前来投资。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2004年，奥巴桑乔任命胡锦涛为总统顾问，负责中小企业发展。一年后，他陪同奥巴桑乔来到中国。访问期间，尼日利亚总统参观了三峡大坝等大型项目，并签署了多项经贸协议。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1999年，奥巴桑乔就任总统，蒂努布就任拉各斯州长时，胡锦涛想做点什么为了代表华侨华人表示支持，他决定兴建学校。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡锦涛历来重视教育事业，帮助兴建了四所学校，每所可容纳3000名学生，设备齐全– 与该国许多其他学校不同 – 有灯光和风扇。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;蒂努布在另一位前中国驻尼日利亚大使梁引柱的陪同下奠基。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2001 年，承认由于胡锦涛的贡献，拉各斯约鲁巴族首领授予他酋长头衔，并经总督批准。胡锦涛穿着约鲁巴人的传统服装出席仪式，酋长向他提供了几个头衔供他选择。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;胡锦涛选择了巴巴·阿塞（Baba Ase），意思是“服务酋长”，并表示他想“服务” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自20世纪80年代以来，中国在非洲的影响力一直引人注目，国有企业大量投资，雇用了大量中国工人。据估计，截至2012年底，生活在非洲国家的中国人已超过100万，根据中国商务部2019年的数据，私营部门目前占中国对非洲直接投资的一半以上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;大英博物馆令人难以置信的中国历史展览是一个启示&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;北京大学非洲研究助理教授徐亮表示，继胡锦涛之后，至少有 22 名中国人获得了这一称号，大约是其中一半是国营公司员工，其余来自私营企业。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“将酋长授予中国人可能是一种趋势，但这不仅仅是因为越来越多的中国人（在非洲）做生意，而且他们的影响力已经越来越大。”长大了，”徐说。 “我们需要明白，西非国家正处于转型之中，他们更有动力吸引那些能够帮助他们发展的人——无论是当地人还是外国人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐，最近出版了《 《中国酋长在非洲：中非人文交流视角分析》一文估计，仅尼日利亚就有数百名外国酋长，其中华人只占一小部分。&lt;

council edict, the paramount ruler of Etung Local Government Area and the member of Etung Traditional Rulers&#39; Council in Cross River, Nigeria, hereby accord official recognition of chieftaincy title to Mr. Adam [Li Manhu] as Ntui Ofa I of Etung Kingdom.” The locals burst into applause.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The video has attracted more than 20,000 likes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Though he says he was confused by the award, Li believes the chieftaincy could be an important networking tool. Unlike Hu, whose father had well-established connections in the country, other Chinese often had difficulty fitting in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li remembers that when he first arrived in Cross River, in 2017, locals often found excuses to wangle money out of the company. When Chinese employees drove on the streets, police might waylay them until they offered baksheesh (a tip or bribe).&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Once when they planned to build a bridge, locals claimed that they needed to pay to worship the river gods. Request refused, they unplugged the company&#39;s electric generator to stop the work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But things changed after Li received the title. There were no river gods to appease. Policemen, on seeing his golden licence plate – reserved only for chiefs – waved his car through checkpoints.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li even encouraged Chinese tourists in Nigeria to download the coronation video and say that they are friends with him to avoid difficulties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But Li&#39;s personal expenses rose. He was invited to local festivals, where he wore traditional clothes. His Douyin recorded these joyful activities: the tribal dances; the rhythmic songs. Sometimes he danced. Sometimes locals asked him to blow air into their hands, a kind of blessing.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;How dams in China are destroying livelihoods downstream in Cambodia&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Of course, he needed to give them money, just like all the other chiefs did. Soon Li was invited to graduation ceremonies, weddings and funerals. “It doesn&#39;t matter if I actually go or not,” he jokes, “as long as the money arrives.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In early 2019, Li was awarded “Ntufam Ofa I of Ekok Chiefdom” by the local Cameroonian chief just across the border, with whom Li also maintained a good relationship. For his second coronation, Li wore a white top, a red robe and a floppy pointed red hat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He rode across the border with the 80-year-old Nigerian head chief – a close friend of his Cameroonian counterpart of the same ethnicity – and arrived in Manyu, the English-speaking region of the francophone country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The host was the governor of Manyu, who wore a white suit and a peaked cap. Li says that in Cameroon the coronation required governmental permission, which made it even more precious.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the announcement, a traditional dancer wearing a rainbow-coloured net that covered his face started jumping and stretching his hands, asking for air-blowing blessings from the two traditional rulers, the governor and the newly enthroned.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While Li attracted wide Chinese coverage as a young man receiving two chieftain titles in different countries – his Cameroonian coronation video gained 300,000 likes on Douyin – there was no trace of him on Cameroonian francophone websites.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It seemed that awarding foreigners chieftain titles had always been controversial in Cameroon. Of the 24 Chinese awarded chieftaincy in West Africa, 21 received Nigerian titles but only two were given Cameroonian ones, which weren&#39;t recognised by the locals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2022, a Mr Long from a private Chinese company was reported on a Cameroonian francophone site as the first-ever third-grade chief in the country. Images of him wearing a golden-rimmed white robe and a turban – like the ruler of the area – went viral on Facebook.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A local internet user was quoted as saying, “A Chinese will one day become the President of Cameroon. We wait for a quick cancellation of this imposture.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Scholars often talk about “indirect rule” in colonial Africa. British Africanist Terence Ranger explained in his 1983 article “The Invention of Tradition” that since the British and African systems were so different, British administrators started to invent African traditions based on what they took to be traditional.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“They set about to codify and promulgate these traditions,” Ranger wrote, “thereby transforming flexible custom into hard prescription.” The invented traditions were also used to redefine the stratified society in which Europeans commanded, and Africans acquiesced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During Africa&#39;s independence movements in the 1960s, leaders and intellectuals often believed chieftaincy was a distortion of traditional kinship by colonial governments and a remnant of colonial rule.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many countries, including Guinea and Tanzania, banned the traditional system. Those that kept it didn&#39;t give it many functions. This might be partly why some Cameroonians raged against a foreign chief.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Historical memories make them very sensitive when a foreigner gains a chieftain title,” Xu writes in the paper about Chinese chiefs. “It&#39;s easy to cause worries about &#39;neocolonialism&#39;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But Xu believes Chinese chiefs don&#39;t belong to the colonial narrative.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“For one thing,” he writes, “the conferment decision is made by African chiefs instead of Chinese, which is fundamentally different from the chiefs appointed by the European colonialists.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“For another, the scrutiny from African people could influence the appointment and removal of foreign chiefs, holding them accountable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;A Chinese artist made Tintin less racist, became one of Hergé&#39;s best friends&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Despite being wary of foreign chiefs, since the 1990s, most Western African countries have witnessed a comeback of the chieftain system. According to Kate Baldwin, a Yale University professor who wrote The Paradox of Traditional Chiefs in Democratic Africa (2015), about 15 per cent of African countries protected chieftaincy in their constitutions when they gained independence. The figure rose to 24 per cent in 2010.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nigeria was a case that stood out. The country might have been the most important testing ground for the British invention: using the emirs of ethnic Hausa-Fulani to dominate the Muslims in the northern states and creating “warrant chiefs” for the ethnic Igbo in southeastern states, who had no chieftaincy tradition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;According to Xu, the colonial creation has often been deemed to be the root of political turbulence in Nigeria, but chieftaincy has thrived, playing a vital role in local development during the economic crises of the 1970s and 80s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Decades after independence, while Nigeria didn&#39;t give any real power to the chiefs in the amended 1999 constitution, it also didn&#39;t impose an outright ban on the system. Nowadays, chiefs are common in Igbo culture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Foreign chiefs are welcomed, though their titles often mean honour instead of power.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In Awka town, there are two levels of chiefs,” says an ethnic Igbo chief, conferred by merit in the Awka community of the southeastern Anambra state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“There is a council of advisers. These are chiefs who represent each of the 33 villages in the Awka community. And honorary chiefs, conferred to those in Awka town who have contributed to the development of the town […] Foreign chiefs usually belong to the honorary chiefs&#39; class.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Laos farmers&#39; livelihoods hang by a thread as Chinese developer drains marsh&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;For this reason, Nigerians didn&#39;t care too much about the conferment. “It&#39;s like getting an honorary degree,” says Vivian Chisom from Anambra, who works for CCECC in Lagos. “I don&#39;t really care if Chinese people are getting titles. It&#39;s ceremonial.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chisom doesn&#39;t know any Chinese chiefs personally, but she has read about Li Manhu on social media. “He definitely does not have any power to decide anything in the community,” she says, adding that, as has not been unheard of, Li may have even bought the title.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Cheng Cheng, a Chinese factory owner in Nigeria, says it is easy to buy honorary titles, but whether the holders can settle problems depends on their abilities, regardless of the title.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li clarifies that he did not buy the title, while Hu shrugs off the suggestion, saying Chinese chiefs “offer contributions and receive thanks. The more thanks, the merrier”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Igbo chief doesn&#39;t know of any Chinese buying titles and claims that the titles aren&#39;t for sale to either citizens or foreigners, at least not in Awka. On the other hand, Samson Fashola, a Nigerian based in China, says, “This is an existing game not unique to Chinese. Our citizens also buy the titles.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Back in 2007, the BBC reported how “Nigerians go crazy for a title”, and locals worried about the debasement of the honour.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The granting of chieftaincy titles to foreign investors can trigger competition between different ethnic groups for state power and external development resources,” Xu writes in his paper. When the head chief decided to grant chieftaincy to Li, a local chief in the council refused.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“He always found excuses to take good projects from our company,” Li says. “He was afraid he wouldn&#39;t be able do it any more if I became a chief.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;African exports to China plunge amid property market slowdown&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;In the end, as the head chief was so determined, the local chief gave up arguing. Li started getting good projects.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li returned to China in late 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. By that time he had been away from his family for three years and had contracted malaria multiple times. He also felt his potential was limited at a state company. He left CGCOC in 2021 and started looking for business opportunities in China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet Africa kept coming to mind. In July 2022, he went to Cameroon to start a trading business. Then in late March, he returned to Nigeria. Though he didn&#39;t live in the Cross River State, his chief status was still recognised.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he introduced himself to potential business partners and government officials, he would offer his ID card – which says Chief Li Manhu – and he says locals would show their respect.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Goodbye,” he posted from Beijing Capital International Airport to his nearly 490,000 Douyin followers. “Although there are so many things I can&#39;t let go here, I feel that my tribe needs me more.”&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 07:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s increase in military exercises helps aid diplomacy efforts]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3230733/chinas-increase-military-exercises-helps-aid-diplomacy-efforts?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 06:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/12/b95db2ae-be83-442a-ad2b-91e7831ddb90_c19fd31d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;In the past decade, China&#39;s People&#39;s Liberation Army (PLA) has expanded its diplomatic outreach under President Xi Jinping&#39;s drive to modernise the country&#39;s military and win global respect.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Analysing articles published by state news agency Xinhua, the South China Morning Post found that since 2013, the number of military exercises held by China with foreign militaries has more than doubled. Its navy has also made more port visits, especially to nations in the Global South.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Military officials in the Central Military Commission, China&#39;s top military command, have also visited more foreign counterparts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But while the PLA, which turned 96 last week, has made these efforts to put forward an image as a force for peace, it has also become more capable of deploying its troops further from its shores. It is something which has drawn suspicion from the US and some others in the West, who have accused China of wanting to reshape the international order against liberal democratic values.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The docking of the PLA&#39;s Yuan Wang 5 tracking ship in Sri Lanka in 2022 drew heavy protests from India, its first foreign base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa caused concern, and more recently, the Ream naval base in Cambodia that China helped build drew fears that the Chinese navy could establish a presence there, despite Beijing&#39;s repeated denials.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In a January hearing on Chinese military diplomacy, Randall Schriver, a commissioner of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said: “Under the guidance of the [Communist Party] and Central Military Commission, the PLA is engaging in military diplomacy of various kinds, is conducting bilateral and multilateral exercises with greater frequency, is creating foreign bases and access opportunities, is engaging in operational military activities with foreign partners, and is active in promoting foreign military sales.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This external agenda is very robust.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Reviewing Xinhua news reports since the 18th party congress in 2012, when Xi took the helm, it could be seen that as the PLA has broadened its diplomatic outreach, Russia followed by Pakistan have remained its top military partners. Ties with them both have continued to grow closer, despite disruption caused by Covid-19.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But in terms of Beijing&#39;s ties with other countries that the PLA seeks to court, China still lags far behind in the substance and depth of joint military drills, experts say.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;China is also interacting less regularly with its top geopolitical rival, the US.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As tensions have risen with the West, military exercises between China and Russia have had the greatest range of areas being trained, with live fire drills and joint rescue missions most common, according to the Post analysis. China has taken part in at least 45 exercises that also involved Russia, with 20 of them bilateral exercises, since the 18th party congress in 2012.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two countries also continued their exercises during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the Zapad/Interaction-2021 and Joint Sea 2021 drills. That was despite a sharp drop of diplomatic outreach from China during its three years of closed borders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that includes China and Russia has been also holding larger combined exercises on counterterrorism.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;As the US and China woo with military drills, who will Southeast Asia choose?&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;The bloc of Central Asian nations plus India, Pakistan and Iran identifies combating terrorism, extremism and separatism as a core tenet of its security policy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;More than 4,000 troops took part in the SCO Peace Mission 2021 drills, held in Russia – the most in the series of exercises. The focus was on combined command and “mixed formations” of personnel of different militaries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The drills with the SCO are much more substantive in scale and in the weapons and equipment sent than those that China holds with Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries,” said Jackie Wong Siu-hei, a predoctoral fellow at George Washington University who has compiled data on China&#39;s military diplomatic outreach from 2000 to 2023.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The only Asean member that China has held military exercises with which involved more sophisticated arms – including armoured vehicles and live-fire drills – is Laos, a country that relies heavily on Chinese infrastructural investment, Wong said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But those drills still pale in comparison to SCO exercises. Wong said the size of the drills and the weaponry China sends reveal its varying military diplomatic goals with other nations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Compared with the US, China&#39;s drills with its Asean neighbours are smaller and less in-depth. In the 2023 Cobra Gold multilateral exercises in Thailand, China only took part in its search and rescue portion with 25 troops. The US sent its biggest contingent in a decade of more than 6,000 troops.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A reason behind the limited engagement between Asean countries and China could lie in America&#39;s long history of working with nations in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;US military outreach has included giving Asian military leaders executive education, as well as the American arms that have made their way to many Asian countries&#39; arsenals. Many aspects of US training have been embedded into the military training of Asean countries – a result of using American arms such as F-16 fighter jets and complying with the confidentiality conditions that come with using these weapons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;By contrast, SCO countries use few US arms.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wong said that meant Asian countries are less inclined to hold in-depth combined training with China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“China might be thinking that it has consolidated its identity that contrasts with the US,” he said. “The US is shooting missiles and holding more live-fire drills. China is perhaps saying that its military cooperation is oriented around peace, unlike the US.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zenobia Chan, a PhD candidate at Princeton University&#39;s politics department and one of Wong&#39;s co-authors in the research, said the vast difference in the level of participation meant military exercises of Asean countries that China takes part in are largely symbolic, with a low level of participation by PLA personnel and the main activity being search and rescue exercises.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Asean countries still participate in them because they wish to maintain good ties with both the US and China, she said, citing interviews with officials from Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“For them, China&#39;s a very important economic partner, whereas the US is more the military partner or guarantor. They don&#39;t want to make either side unhappy. So it means that they are constrained by US factors in that they can&#39;t work too closely with China, but they also don&#39;t want to offend China, if you will.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chan said in countries that receive a lot of arms deliveries from the US, the number of Chinese infrastructure projects correlated with the number of combined military exercises. That correlation does not exist with countries that do not use many American arms.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Our theory is that because a lot of countries rely a lot on trade with China and also these infrastructure projects, they want to preserve that economic relationship with China. On the other hand, those countries that actually receive lots of American arms deliveries, they also rely on the US for security.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“And to please both sides, they do these more symbolic exercises with China in order to placate China while still getting US arms deliveries or security guarantees in some cases,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some of those symbolic acts of diplomatic outreach also include port visits and senior level meetings, such as those between defence ministers and more senior officials including the vice-chairmen of China&#39;s Central Military Commission (CMC), the country&#39;s highest military command.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Senior-level meetings are part of the key performance indicators of military diplomacy, Chan said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The upper level, they want you to do military diplomacy. And how do you show that you have done your military diplomacy, then? You visit. That&#39;s just how the incentive structure is set up within [China],” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many of the port visits were performed in Africa by fleets on missions in the Gulf of Aden to protect ships from pirates. In 2023, the fleet visited Nigeria, Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon and Ghana, and held combined exercises with their militaries, the review of Xinhua articles shows.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;China&#39;s Peace Ark missions that provide free medical care to local residents also perform a bulk of the diplomatic outreach. This year, the hospital ship visited Kiribati and the Solomon Islands; the Pacific nations that switched diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Pacific is emerging as one of the most active theatres of the China-US geopolitical rivalry. The US with its regional allies have met with multiple countries in the Western Pacific to counter Chinese initiatives there, such as a policing pact signed with the Solomons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Though the US and China once held bilateral military exercises, these stopped in 2019. The last one was a humanitarian assistance and disaster management drill in Hawaii involving more than 200 Chinese troops and as many American troops.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now, the only time Chinese and American troops would take part in drills together would be in exercises involving several countries, such as this year&#39;s Cobra Gold and those under the banner of Asean Defence Ministers&#39; Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) which includes the 10 Asean members as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“China&#39;s military diplomacy is becoming a more prominent component of its overall foreign policy,” said Anna Ashton, director of China corporate affairs and US-China relations at risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “With regard to security issues, China is asserting an alternative vision for maintaining international peace and security.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xi&#39;s vision for world safety is encapsulated in his Global Security Initiative (GSI), which confronts some foreign policy principles of the West. It criticises sanctions that have not been authorised by the UN Security Council and supports regional groupings in the Global South, which aligns with Beijing&#39;s long-time opposition against non-Asian countries weighing in on contentious issues such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The GSI is China&#39;s concept for maintaining global peace and security in the 21st century,” Ashton said. “It is still fairly abstract, but it clearly supports China&#39;s vision of the ideal global architecture in contrast to the existing, US-dominated architecture.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 06:20:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Zelensky thanks Germany’s Olaf Scholz for additional Patriot launchers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3230913/zelensky-thanks-germanys-olaf-scholz-additional-patriot-launchers?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 06:09&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/13/b8489b37-c527-4b45-a762-53e6f0ad45b9_b219e16a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked Germany and its Chancellor Olaf Scholz for two additional Patriot air defence system launchers his embattled country has received.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This is very important,” Zelensky said in his evening address on Saturday.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Thank you.

The show, which ran to 29 45-minute episodes, centres on a rape case: beautiful, young personal assistant Zhao Xun accuses her powerful and handsome boss, Cheng Gong, the company president, of raping her. But the case is complex, and so are the characters involved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Within three months, Cheng, a married man, promotes Zhao from a trainee to the position of senior assistant, multiplies her salary and showers her with gifts worth 880,000 yuan (US$122,170). She makes little attempt to stop him. Then one rainy night, the police turn up at the company&#39;s apartment suite, having received an anonymous tip-off about rape. Zhao, traumatised and confused, denies she has been violated. Five days later, she files a lawsuit against him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The popular and high-quality drama led to a heated discussion among the audience about the nature of sexual harassment, gender inequality, the unbalanced power play in the office and, interestingly, who is really the victim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many viewers disliked Zhao, accusing her of being weak, vain and greedy. One said the character was someone “who wants to be a mistress but also wants a chastity arch” – a memorial used to mark a woman&#39;s extraordinary chastity in feudal times. Some said Zhao had hardly said “no” throughout the drama. “A girl, no matter how naive and stupid, knows how to say no. So, Zhao Xun is just a cunning woman who wants to have things without putting in the effort,” one said. Some – mostly male, I imagine – even claimed the president was the real victim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the show&#39;s opening scene, Zhao, wrapped in a white towel, is curled up in a bathtub, crying while it rains outside and her boss sleeps in the bedroom. Her pained expression tells me clearly that she felt violated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even if she did not fight back when he forced himself upon her, her silence did not mean she was willing. As long as a person does not give consent for the sexual intercourse, it is rape. It is obvious to me that she didn&#39;t. Before entering the bedroom, it&#39;s clear she wants to leave but he picks her up and takes her to bed. It&#39;s clear to me that he committed sexual violence, a crime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many in the audience have scrutinised areas where Zhao could have done better; for example, she could have refused his gifts. But the reality is that in many Chinese companies, the boss has such power over his employees that refusing his gift may mean the end of employment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am not too surprised by the criticism aimed at Zhao. The character assassination of rape victims is not an uncommon practice, and not just in China. Some 35 years ago, Hollywood produced a rather unusual film called The Accused, which focused on the victim&#39;s experience. A young woman is gang-raped in a bar by three men. She successfully sues them and the bystanders. Her character comes into question when her attackers are prosecuted. Does she have a history of drinking? Was her skirt too short?&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Imperfect Victim, the president countersues Zhao for defamation. Her personal information is leaked, she is ruthlessly attacked online and her reputation is ruined. Unable to bear it all, she tries to commit suicide but survives with serious injuries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In real life, her death would have been a probable outcome. But the director decided to put a positive spin on it. Helped by her brilliant lawyer, Zhao wins the case, and Cheng is ordered to apologise to her. And she gets the 1 yuan compensation she asked for – it was never about the money but about clearing her name. For me, that was an unrealistic touch in an otherwise very realistic drama.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhou Xiaoxuan, a prominent face in China&#39;s #MeToo movement, was also sued for defamation after she accused Zhu Jun, a high-profile TV presenter, of sexual assault. She countersued, demanding an apology and compensation, and failed. Last year, her appeal was dismissed after a court in Beijing ruled that she lacked sufficient evidence. This was hardly a surprising result. High legal barriers and social stigma have silenced many victims.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am delighted to see a TV drama like Imperfect Victim dealing with such serious social issues head on. For centuries, Confucianist ideas that women are inferior dominated Chinese society. It is partly due to the deeply rooted patriarchal culture that sexual harassment is prevalent in the workplace, so much so that on International Women&#39;s Day this year, the government issued a guidance specifically to combat the problem.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I do find the title Imperfect Victim problematic in that it might further encourage a victim-blaming culture. Let&#39;s not focus on the weaknesses of the victim but examine the perpetrator with a critical eye. A victim is a victim, whether she is perfect or not.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 06:20:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump swoops into Iowa Fair to scramble DeSantis’ effort to reboot campaign]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3230912/trump-swoops-iowa-fair-scramble-desantis-effort-reboot-campaign?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 05:20&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/13/6430402b-ac0b-48fa-ba4f-f47d43b4f962_87fcf05e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Republican presidential rivals Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis were holding competing events in the early nominating state of Iowa on Saturday, at a time when the former president overwhelmingly dominates opinion polls and the Florida governor is scrambling to reset his troubled campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;DeSantis, who has had two staff shake-ups in the past three weeks and is sinking in the polls, had long planned to attend the Iowa State Fair, a political must for aspiring presidential candidates in the state that kicks off the Republican nominating contest in January.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Trump&#39;s late announcement on Tuesday that he was also going to attend the event on the same day as DeSantis amounted to a political gatecrashing of an appearance the Florida governor hopes will kick-start his stalled campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;DeSantis is making a high-risk bet that he can halt Trump&#39;s march to the Republican presidential nomination by winning Iowa.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Asked about his governing style on Saturday, DeSantis said he cared more about protecting voters than his own fortunes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“So we&#39;ll do what&#39;s right. We&#39;ll take the consequences and let the chips fall where they may,” he said in an interview with Iowa&#39;s Republican Governor Kim Reynolds at the fair.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the start of the interview, Reynolds reproached a group of protesters who were blowing whistles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later on, a large crowd cheered Trump as he arrived at the fair.后来他在露天酒吧发表演讲，吹嘘自己目前的领先地位。 “We&#39;re way up in the polls,” Trump said.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;DeSantis replaces campaign manager as 2024 US presidential bid flounders&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;While DeSantis steered clear of attacking Trump, DeSantis barbs were fair game for the former president. He told reporters he did not think he had written off the Florida governor too early.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Asked whether he saw DeSantis as his main rival, Trump responded: “I don&#39;t see him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Trump, the Republican frontrunner by a large margin, brought along a delegation of Florida Republicans who endorsed him over DeSantis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“When the other candidates came here they had like six people,” Trump told supporters in a speech at a restaurant bar at the fairgrounds. “We stopped at three different places and we&#39;ve never been treated so well.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Judge warns Trump not to threaten witnesses in 2020 election subversion case&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Iowa holds the first of the state-by-state Republican nominating contests on January 15. DeSantis hopes that a win in the Midwestern state will give him valuable momentum against Trump before primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Trump&#39;s appearance at the fair could steal the limelight from the governor and dominate the headlines. It is held in the state capital Des Moines and runs from August 10 to August 20. Last year, it attracted more than 1 million visitors.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Trump&#39;s appearance will also complicate efforts for the rest of the Republican field. Apart from Trump and DeSantis, nine other candidates will be attending the fair between August 11 and August 18, but all are languishing in single digits, more than 40 points behind Trump according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely Republican voters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;According to that August 3 poll, Trump also leads DeSantis by 34 points, 47 per cent to 13 per cent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Most of Trump&#39;s rivals had agreed to be interviewed individually by Reynolds between August 11 and August 18. Trump turned down her invitation, angered by her public neutrality in the primary race and her appearance with DeSantis at several of his Iowa events.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On stage with Reynolds, DeSantis avoided speaking about Trump, instead homing in on Biden&#39;s economic policy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“On day one, we take all Biden regulations and executive orders and throw them in the trash can,” DeSantis said. “Bidenomics is basically Americans have a lower standard of living so that he can pursue his political, ideological agenda, and that is not acceptable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Additional reporting by Bloomberg&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 05:50:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta confirms Lil Tay’s Instagram account was hacked in death hoax amid publicity stunt claims]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3230911/meta-confirms-lil-tays-instagram-account-was-hacked-death-hoax-amid-publicity-stunt-claims?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 04:45&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/13/b0bb8c01-766f-4597-b226-45a367141c67_386bc7ed.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Lil Tay&#39;s Instagram account was indeed hacked, leading to a post that falsely reported the Asian rapper&#39;s death earlier this week, according to Meta.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Despite swirling allegations the hoax was just a ploy for publicity, the social media giant – which owns Instagram – confirmed the hacking to TMZ on Saturday, noting it helped the controversial 14-year-old regain control of her account.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A statement claiming to be from the family of Tay was posted to her feed on Wednesday, alleging she and brother Jason Tian, 21, had both suddenly died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We have no words to express the unbearable loss and indescribable pain,” read the since-deleted post. “Her brother&#39;s passing adds an even more unimaginable depth to our grief. During this time of immense sorrow, we kindly ask for privacy as we grieve this overwhelming loss, as the circumstances surrounding [Tay] and her brother&#39;s passing are still under investigation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;News of their deaths rocked social media, however suspicions grew throughout the day as some close to Tay, whose mother is Chinese, said they could not (or would not) confirm the allegations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;According to Business Insider, Tay&#39;s father, Christopher Hope, “declined to answer whether his daughter was still alive,” while her former manager Harry Tsang said the situation called for “cautious consideration.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What&#39;s more, police departments in both Los Angeles (where Tay reportedly lived) and Vancouver (where she grew up) said they had no reports of her death and no investigations into the case.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The following day, Tay confirmed to TMZ that not only are she and her brother alive, but her account had been “compromised by a 3rd party and used to spread jarring misinformation and rumours.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But questions about the legitimacy of the hacking claims soon arose, with many on social media wondering if the death hoax was instead a publicity stunt or “shameless cry for attention.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Lil Tay not dead, says her social media accounts were hacked: new report&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;In a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday, Tsang said he believes “the reported hacking incident may not have occurred” – and suggested Tay&#39;s older brother may be to blame.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“My rationale for this perspective is twofold,” he explained, while noting that he has not spoken to Tay&#39;s family in two years. “Firstly, the restoration of a compromised account on platforms like Meta/Instagram typically does not necessitate a 24-hour time frame. Secondly, the actions of Lil Tay&#39;s brother, renowned for his propensity for extreme measures, led me to hypothesise an alternative motive behind this occurrence.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tsang went on to suggest that money and renewed fame could have been motivations behind both the hoax and hacking claims – “an endeavour to illicitly extract funds from devoted supporters and unwitting bystanders,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before this week, Tay&#39;s brother was believed to be the source of 2021 posts accusing their father of abuse.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 04:50:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Six dead after migrant boat capsizes in Channel, search continues for the missing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3230910/six-dead-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-channel-search-continues-missing?utm_source=rss_feed]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023.08.13 03:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_twitter_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/13/a65f38ae-eb81-40e6-bacf-7a5c1c5c4d09_7f1aa430.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;p>;Six Afghans died when a migrant boat heading to Britain sank in the Channel on Saturday, French officials said, as a search continued to find those still missing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This shipwreck is a terrible human tragedy,” French State Secretary for the Sea Herve Berville told reporters at the port of Calais, the hub for rescue operations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He denounced “criminal traffickers” who send migrants “to their death” and pledged to fight their smuggling networks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The deputy public prosecutor for the coastal city of Boulogne, Philippe Sabatier, told Agence France-Presse all six fatalities were Afghan men believed to be in their 30s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rest of the passengers were “almost all Afghans with some Sudanese, mostly adults with some minors”, he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The French and British coastguard services rescued 61 survivors, said Berville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;French coastal authority Premar said up to two people could still be missing and that search efforts would continue until nightfall.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic loss of life in the Channel today,” British interior minister Suella Braverman said on social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne posted that her “thoughts go out to the victims” as she praised the efforts of the rescue teams.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;41 migrants, including 3 kids, missing after Mediterranean shipwreck&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;“It&#39;s pretty tough, they&#39;re humans.

Girls had been banned from school beyond sixth grade soon after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. Afghanistan is the only country in the world with bans on female education.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Afghanistan&#39;s higher education minister, Nida Mohammed Nadim, said at the time the university ban was necessary to prevent the mixing of genders and because he believed some subjects being taught violated the principles of Islam.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said the ban, issued from the southern city of Kandahar by the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, was in place until further notice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;An adviser at the Higher Education Ministry, Molvi Abdul Jabbar, said universities were ready to readmit female students as soon as Akhundzada gives the order for the ban to be lifted. He was unable to say when or if that would happen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Akhundzada “ordered that the universities be closed, so they closed,” he told Associated Press. “当他说营业时，他们就会在同一天营业。 All our leaders are in favour of (restarting girls&#39; education), even our ministers are in favour of it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jabbar said he last met Akhundzada seven or eight years ago. He fought alongside him against the Russians during the 10-year Soviet war in Afghanistan and has been part of the Taliban for 27 years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It is only because of our obedience (to Akhundzada) that we are following his orders,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;&#39;Who will be the midwives?&#39;: Shut out of jobs, Afghan women retrain as nurses&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;His comments are another sign of diverging opinions within the Taliban about the decision-making process and Akhundzada&#39;s edicts, with chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid moving quickly to reject reports of division. They also show the authority that Akhundzada wields over the Taliban.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nadim had presented the ban as a temporary measure while solutions were found to fix issues around gender segregation, course material and dress codes. He said universities would reopen for women once they were resolved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Taliban made similar promises about secondary school access for girls, saying classes would resume for them once “technical issues” around uniforms and transport were sorted out, but girls are still shut out of classrooms.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jabbar said the education sector was as it was before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Everything is ready in advance, whether it&#39;s school or university studies.可能是（开始）时间不同，早上有男生，下午有女生。 Or there will be girls in the morning and boys in the afternoon.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;His comments come days ahead of the second anniversary of the Taliban&#39;s return to power.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 03:20:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
